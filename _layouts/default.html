				<h1>Is My Battery Charging? State Switching Attack on EV Charging</h1>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<p> Electric Vehicle (EV) has become one of the promising solutions to the ever-evolving environmental and energy crisis. The key to the wide adoption of EV is a pervasive charging infrastructure, composed of both the private/home chargers and the public/commercial charging stations. The security of EV charging, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper focuses on the communication mechanisms between the chargers and EVs, and exposes the lack of protection on the message authenticity in the SAE J1772 charging control protocol.

In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks, ChargeX, which aims to manipulate the charging states or charging rates of EV chargers with the goal of disrupting the charging schedules, causing denial of service (DoS), or degrading the battery performance. ChargeX comprises two types of attacks: (i) Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI)-based attack leverages the effects of inductive coupling to influence the current readings along the power line, and (ii) cable tampering attack inserts a hardware attack circuit to strategically modify the charging control signals. We design and implement multiple attack systems, and evaluate the attacks on a public charging station and two home chargers using a simulated vehicle load in the lab environment. Extensive experiments on different types of chargers demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of ChargeX. Specifically, we demonstrate that ChargeX can force the switching of an EV's charging state from ``stand by" to ``charging", even when the vehicle is not in the charging state. We further validate the attacks on a Tesla vehicle to showcase the disruptive impacts of ChargeX. If deployed, ChargeX may significantly demolish people's trust in the EV charging infrastructure. Finally, we discuss the potential countermeasures to defend against this new threat.
